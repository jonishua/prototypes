# Media Placeholders

Store project hero media here. Recommended naming matches `media` field in `src/data/projects.ts`.

Suggested formats:

- MP4 videos encoded with H.264 + AAC for broad browser support
- Animated GIF/WebM for lightweight loops
- Static JPG/PNG for concept art placeholders

Provide a matching poster image (e.g. `fallback-poster.png`) if the video takes time to buffer.
